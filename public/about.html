<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> First and foremost I am a father of 1 daughter, but I am expecting a second child early next year. I am not so secretly hoping for a boy so I have one of each.
  Work wise I have experience in Construction Sales, and I have a Diploma of Aviation where I got my Commercial Pilots license at Southern Wings NZ.
  I am accredited to fly Single Pilot Multi Engine IFR (Instrument Flight Rules), However poor timing of Covid and a young family has seen me look to specialise in work that allows me to not travel as much. 
  I also have a small business selling home office furniture online, HomeOfficeSpace.co.nz
</p>

<p>I am an avid sports lover, particularly team sports. My favourite teams being, the NZ Warriors, All Blacks, Boston Celtics, Oklahoma City Thunder, Leicester City & Manchester United. Im particularly interested by the team building nature of sports like the NBA where they use a Draft based system. 
  To keep fit I love a weekend Bike ride, its easier on my joints as I get older and older</p>

<p>Software Development is the next string I intend to add to my bow, its great having something for continuous growth and improvement</p>
